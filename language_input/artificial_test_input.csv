The
man
walked
down
the
street
looking
for
a
coffee
shop
She
opened
the
fridge
and
reached
for
the
milk
to
pour
He
picked
up
the
phone
and
dialed
his
mother's
number
slowly
The
dog
barked
loudly
before
running
to
fetch
the
red
ball
They
arrived
late
but
quickly
found
their
seats
near
the
front
The
baby
cried
until
her
mother
picked
her
up
to
soothe
He
looked
at
the
clock
and
realized
he
was
very
late
The
teacher
wrote
the
homework
instructions
clearly
on
the
white
board
She
packed
her
suitcase
carefully
and
checked
her
passport
again
twice
We
sat
by
the
fire
watching
sparks
rise
into
the
night
The
kids
played
outside
until
the
sun
disappeared
behind
the
hills
I
turned
the
page
and
began
reading
the
final
chapter
slowly
She
stirred
the
soup
gently
while
humming
a
quiet
familiar
tune
They
locked
the
doors
and
turned
off
every
single
light
inside
The
cat
leapt
onto
the
windowsill
to
watch
the
birds
He
tied
his
shoes
tightly
before
sprinting
toward
the
finish
line
She
opened
the
envelope
slowly
and
found
the
letter
she
expected
The
wind
blew
harder
and
scattered
the
papers
across
the
yard
They
clapped
and
cheered
loudly
as
the
winner
raised
his
trophy
He
spread
jam
on
the
toast
and
poured
himself
some
coffee
The
plane
touched
down
gently
and
taxied
toward
the
arrival
gate
We
watched
the
sunset
together
in
silence
from
the
wooden
deck
He
grabbed
his
coat
and
keys
before
stepping
out
the
door
The
music
started
playing
and
everyone
got
up
to
dance
She
placed
the
flowers
carefully
into
the
glass
vase
nearby
I
checked
the
locks
again
and
turned
off
all
the
lights
The
audience
waited
quietly
for
the
performer
to
begin
her
song
He
chopped
the
vegetables
quickly
and
added
them
to
the
pan
We
followed
the
trail
markers
until
we
reached
the
waterfall
overlook
The
children
gathered
their
books
and
rushed
out
the
classroom
door
